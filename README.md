# reactor
A light-weight, decentralized, responsive variable framework.


### Future plans
As of writing, Go doesn't have generics, so anything like this is done using 
`interface{}` which works, but it's clunky. Whenever Go introduces generics, I 
will update this to include them as soon as possible, with a major version
increase accordingly.

In `reactor/slice`, an implementation of Binder is possible, but not a priority, since Binder 
implementations are not the primary feature of this module.
