# go-reactor
A responsive variable framework



### Future plans
As of writing, Go doesn't have generics, so anything like this is done using `interface{}`, which is clunky. 
Whenever Go introduces generics, I will update this to include them as soon as possible, with a major version
increase accordingly.
